# Physics Simulation Module

A module for simulating physics in two-dimensional space, including vectors, shapes, rigid bodies, and a physics world to manage interactions between objects.

## Introduction

This module provides tools for creating and simulating physical objects in 2D environments. It is ideal for game development, simulations, and educational purposes where realistic physics interactions are desired.

## Features

- **Vector Calculations**: Handle 2D vectors for positions, velocities, and forces.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Create circles, rectangles, and polygons for physical objects.
- **Rigid Bodies**: Simulate objects with mass, velocity, and collision properties.
- **Physics World**: Manage multiple rigid bodies, apply gravity, and handle collisions between objects.
- **Event Handling**: Listen to and react to events such as collisions between objects.

## Installation

To use the module in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Module**: Download or copy `physics.js` into your project directory.

2. **Initialize Your Project**: If you haven't already, initialize your project using npm.

   ```bash
   npm init -y


## Reusability
To reuse the module in your projects:

**Modular Structure**: The module is structured for easy integration. You can import the classes you need and extend or modify them as necessary.
**Extensibility**: Add your own shapes or extend existing classes to customize the module to your needs.
**Event Handling**: Use the event system to integrate physics events with your game or application logic.
**Integration with Rendering**: Connect the physics world with your rendering system to visually represent the simulation.
