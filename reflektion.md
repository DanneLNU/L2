# Code Quality Analysis Based on Chapter 2: *Meaningful Names* and my own reflections.

| **Identifier Name** | **Applied Rules from Chapter 2**         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Vector2D`          | - Use Intention-Revealing Names          | 
|                     | - Use Pronouncable names                 |
|                     |                                          |
|                     | The name Vector2d is clearly indicating  |
|                     | that the class handles two-dimensional   |
|                     | vectors. It reveals its purpose without  | 
|                     | ambiguity and is easily pronouncable,    | 
|                     | making the communication effective       |
|                     | among the developers.                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RigidBody`         |- Use Intention-Revealing Names           |
|                     |- Avoid Disinformation                    |
|                     | RigidBody accurately describes an        |
|                     | object that does not deform under force  |
|                     | aligning with physics terminology.       |
|                     | It avoids disinformation by not implying |
|                     | properties it does not have, ensuring    |
|                     | developers understand its purpose without|
|                     | confusion.                               |
